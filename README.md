# JavaScript Project 2

## 📋 Overview

This project is designed to enhance your JavaScript skills by implementing a series of functions that perform various operations. The tasks are categorized into three main sections:

1. **String Manipulation Functions**
2. **Array Functions**
3. **Mathematical Functions**

Each function focuses on a specific operation, allowing you to practice and understand fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## 🧠 Requirements

### 1. String Manipulation Functions

- **Reverse a String**: Create a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.
- **Count Characters**: Develop a function that counts and returns the number of characters in a given string.
- **Capitalize Words**: Implement a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

### 2. Array Functions

- **Find Maximum and Minimum**: Write functions to determine the maximum and minimum values within an array of numbers.
- **Sum of Array**: Create a function that calculates and returns the sum of all elements in an array.
- **Filter Array**: Implement a function that filters out elements from an array based on a specified condition.

### 3. Mathematical Functions

- **Factorial**: Develop a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
- **Prime Number Check**: Create a function to check whether a number is prime.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Implement a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
